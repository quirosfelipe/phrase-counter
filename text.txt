to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of
animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even
from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under
confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family,
which seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest

seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not
be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting
irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I
